# 🧠 Retail Inventory Optimization with Multi-Agent Simulation

A retail inventory management simulation powered by intelligent agents. This project showcases how agents representing stores, customers, warehouses, and suppliers can interact to maintain inventory flow, forecast demand, and avoid stockouts.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🧰 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- Flask-CORS

http://localhost:8000
Click "Run Simulation" and see results + agent interactions!

🧠 Agents Involved
Agent	Role
Customer	Generates demand signal randomly
Store	Forecasts demand and checks if restock is needed
Warehouse	Checks inventory, dispatches items or forwards request to supplier
Supplier	Always fulfills order and ships to warehouse
🎨 Frontend
A lightweight HTML/CSS/JS interface powered by fetch() to call the backend and show results. You can customize the UI or connect it to a 3D environment using Three.js or Unity.

📌 Notes
This is a simplified simulation and can be extended with:

LLM-based agents using LangGraph or CrewAI

Inventory database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)

Forecasting models (Prophet, ARIMA)

Real-time frontend with charts or 3D agents
